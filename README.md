# COMP6176-LAB Project

This repo contains my submission to my university's Human Computer Interaction class project (`COMP6176`)

We were tasked to make a clone [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/home) website with the following requirements:
* No framework; Only raw HTML + CSS + JS (and JQuery but I didn't use it)
* Has a header, navbar (i don't know the difference??), content and footer
* Has 5 pages (Home, Character, About Game, Gallery and Registration page)
* Responsive (Under 800px screen)
* Nothing taken from the Internet (This point is weird; All images are taken from either Genshin Impact's site or is a fan art of it; They are okay with it)
